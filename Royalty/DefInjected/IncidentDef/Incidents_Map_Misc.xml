  <!-- EN: A {PAWN_title} named {PAWN_nameDef} is crashing in a transport pod nearby.\n\n{PAWN_nameDef} is suffering from {HEDIFF_label} and will be unable to walk.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} will recover naturally after many days. There is also a chance of a lucky quick recovery. {HEDIFF_label} can also be cured by a special operation which requires a large amount of glitterworld medicine.\n\n[PAWN_pronoun] is willing to contribute once {PAWN_pronoun} has recovered, but will not leave voluntarily. If you don't want {PAWN_nameDef}, you can banish {PAWN_objective}, sell {PAWN_objective} into slavery or leave {PAWN_objective} to die. However, your other colonists may find this disturbing. -->
